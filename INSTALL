OBSY Personal Observatory Management System
Installation Guide 0.01 (Pre-release)
Pre-requisites:
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3 python3-venv

To install Obsy first clone the repository from github:

git clone https://github.com/gordtulloch/obsy.git

Create a new virtual environment for Obsy

    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\scripts\activate.bat  (in Windows)
    source ./venv/bin/activate  (Linux)

Next install all of the required dependencies with pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the database server structure and load all of the core Obsy tables:

    python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser account so you can log in

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Install the cron jobs required for regular operations by listing existing crontab and adding new entries

    crontab -l -u $USER | cat - cronjobs.txt | crontab -u $USER -

Finally run the server (0.0.0.0 means any other computer on your network can access, use 127.0.0.1:8000 if you only want it to be accessed locally)

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Private settings
Some settings are used for testing but can't be added to the repository. These are stored in a file named obsy/private.ini. 
This file is not included in the repository and is created the first time the program is run. It will be created with default settings 
so please edit this file appropriately.
