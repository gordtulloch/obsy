OBSY Personal Observatory Management System
Installation Guide 0.01 (Pre-release)

To install Obsy first clone the repository from github:

git clone https://github.com/gordtulloch/obsy.git

Create a new virtual environment for Obsy

python -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate.bat  (in Windows)
source ./venv/bin/activate  (Linux)

Next install all of the required dependencies with pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the database server structure and load all of the core Obsy tables:

$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py loaddata obsy.json

Finally run the server 

python manage.py runserver

# Asynchronous Tasks
Obsy uses Celery and Celery Beat to schedule tasks. 

sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo service redis-server enable
sudo service redis-server start
sudo service redis-server status

sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
Look for the following and ensure it's not commented out:
port 6379

redis-cli ping

pip install celery redis
# Start the Celery worker
celery -A obsy worker --loglevel=info

# Start the Celery Beat scheduler
celery -A obsy beat --loglevel=info

Private settings
Some settings are used for testing but can't be added to the repository. These are stored in a file named obsy/private.ini. 
This file is not included in the repository and must be created the first time the program is run. It will be created with default settings 
so please edit this file appropriately.
